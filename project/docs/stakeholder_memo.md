# Stakeholder Memo

## Project Overview
This project aims to build a **predictive model** that estimates whether an asset’s next-period return will move **up (1)** or **down (0)**. The model will be based on **XGBoost**, a gradient boosting algorithm, and will use features derived from returns, volatility, trading volume, technical indicators (e.g., moving averages, RSI), and calendar effects.  

The output is not a raw price forecast, but a **calibrated probability of an upward move**, designed to be consumed as a **trading signal**.

## Stakeholder & User
The **primary stakeholders** are **quantitative portfolio managers and traders**.  
- Portfolio managers want a systematic way to identify opportunities and control risk.  
- Traders want **clear, actionable signals** that can be backtested and integrated into daily decision-making.  

This project addresses both needs by producing a signal that can be tested historically, evaluated quantitatively, and applied in live trading workflows.

## Why It Matters
Financial markets are noisy and volatile. Even a modest predictive edge—if stable and well-calibrated—can **improve portfolio returns, reduce drawdowns, and guide position sizing**. By providing an interpretable, repeatable signal, this project supports more disciplined trading decisions and reduces reliance on intuition.

## Useful Answer
A **useful deliverable** for stakeholders is:
- A **trained XGBoost model** + inference pipeline that outputs daily probabilities of an up move.  
- Performance evaluation with both **machine learning metrics** (AUC, PR-AUC, F1) and **trading diagnostics** (Sharpe ratio, drawdown, turnover).  
- Model interpretation (e.g., SHAP values) to explain which features drive predictions, supporting trust and adoption.
